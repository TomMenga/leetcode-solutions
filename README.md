# LeetCode Solutions

It's not the first and probably won't be the last repository of solutions to LeetCode problems.  
At the moment, it is though as a personal use repo to train for tech-interview questions.

The chosen language is **Javascript** and will probably be used for the majority of the solutions.  
I'd rather use typescript, however some suggested to not getting too used to it.

Feel free to **consult** it or **contribute** to it.

I am picking problems from the [Grind75 study plan](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75).  
You can freely configure it to match your needs and time.
